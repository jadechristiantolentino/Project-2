            <h2>Bordeaux</h2>
            <p>Bordeaux might just be one of the most underrated cities in all of Europe. This is something you’ll
                realize as soon as you step under the Gothic Porte Cailhau and onto the cobbled streets of Saint Pierre,
                the medieval old town, and you wonder why the throngs of tourists have not also descended on this scene
                straight out of a storybook.</p>
